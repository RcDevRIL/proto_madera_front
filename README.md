# proto_madera_front - README V0.2
[![Codemagic build status][]][latest_build]

Welcome on our development repository for our graduation project!! 

    You will find here the Flutter mobile application that we produce for our graduation 
    projectduring a 2-years work-study program with CESI Dijon school.
  
*Distributed by __LesCodeursEnBois__ - CESI RIL B2 - 2018-2020*

## Getting Started

This README will guide you through the setup and deployment of this application on a virtual device (or physical if you have one).

    /!\ This README is a work in **progress** ! /!\
    
##### Things to add on this README

* [X] codemagic badges to show build/test status
* [ ] Packages used to run the app
* [X] How to install/run app on device
* [X] How to run tests
* [ ] How to ...

#### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them

* First you will need a copy of this repository: either use "Download" feature on [this][Github root] page, or use Git CLI if you have installed it on your computer:
    * 'git clone https://github.com/RcDevRIL/proto_madera_front.git'

* Now you need to have the Flutter SDK to use CLI and run the app on device. Please refer to [Flutter "get started"] guide.


#### Run app on device

If you went through all the steps on [flutter.dev][Flutter "get started"] you should have your favorite editor with plugins installed to connect to your device easily. 

To start build/install, execute this command:

        'flutter run'

This will install app on the connected device and run it. 

_If you have a real device, just plug it to the computer using your USB cable. The Flutter plugin should notice the device and will automatically add it on the list._

#### Run tests

_This paragraph explain how to trigger tests written in the **[test]** folder of this repository._

To start tests, execute this command:

        'flutter test'

This will trigger the execution of tests. Depending on your IDE, you should see the results pretty easily. 

## Built With
